# Supervised Learning
In Supervised learning, the machine is trained using data which is well "labeled." It means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the presence of a supervisor or a teacher. A supervised learning algorithm learns from labeled training data and it helps to predict outcomes for unforeseen data. 

Let's say, we want to train a machine to help us predict how long it will take us to drive home from our workplace. So at first, we start by creating a set of labeled data which includes
    1. Weather conditions
    2. Time of the day
    3. Holidays

All these details are our inputs. The output is the amount of time it took us to drive back home on that specific day. We know that if it's raining outside, then it will take us longer to drive home. But the machine needs data and statistics. So the first thing we require is to create a training data set. This training set will contain the total commute time and corresponding factors like weather, time, etc. Based on this training set, our machine might see there's a direct relationship between the amount of rain and time we will take to get home.

So, it infers that the more it rains, the longer we will be driving to get back to our home. It might also see the connection between the time we leave work and the time we'll be on the road.The closer we're to 5:30 p.m. the longer time it takes for us to get home. Our machine may find some of the relationships with our labeled data.

Similarly, the data modal will also predict on how rain impacts the way people drive. It also starts to see that more people travel during a particular time of day.

# Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where we do not need to supervise the model. Instead, we need to allow the model to work on its own to discover information. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms allow us to perform more complex processing tasks compared to supervised learning.

Let's say, in a family there is baby and a family dog. The baby knows and identifies the dog. A few weeks later a relative brings along a new dog and tries to play with the baby. The baby has not seen this new dog earlier. But it recognizes many features (2 ears, eyes, walking on 4 legs) which are like baby's pet dog. The baby identifies the new animal like a dog. This is unsupervised learning, where we are not taught but we learn from the data (in this case data about a dog.) If this would have been supervised learning, the relative would have told the baby that it's a dog.
