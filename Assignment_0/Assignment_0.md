# What is the definition of Machine Learning according to Arthur Samuel ? 
Ans: According to Arthur Samuel who coined the name Machine Learning in 1959, it is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. More elaborately, it reads data, analyse it, identify the pattern and based on analysis it will perform operations, it will change rest of its flow, it will do suggestions & recommendations, without being explicitly programmed.

# What is the definition of Machine Learning according to Tom Mitchell ?
Ans: According to Tom Mitchell, the field of machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience. A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. It could be used as a design tool to help us think clearly about what data the machine needs to collect (E), what decisions the software needs to make (T) and how it will evaluate its results (P). 

# Using an example of machine learning problem (Anything that you can pose) explain it using the terms in Question2 in your own words
Ans: According to Tom Mitchell, a machine learning modal should be able to infer or predict results based on rules that it has learnt or made while training based on numerous data. If we have a set of data comprising of players and sports team, based on Tom Mitchell's definition, if a player X plays on team T and team T plays sport S, then probably the player X plays S. Here the data (E) will be the players and the sports team, the decisions it will make (T) will be to tell which player might play which sport and the the results (p), it will verify based on the rules that it has learnt while accumulating all the data (E).
